# small-project

This is my first repository on GitHub. 
This repository contains my own personal small, lightweight projects. No particular languages are used. 
Nothing special. :)

1. min-twitter-bot is written in JS. This bot helps you to search, post and reply tweets without opening twitter.com (why would you ever need this? I don't know). Computation supported by Node.JS
